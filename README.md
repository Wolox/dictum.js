# Dictum.js

Create automatic documentation of your NodeJS API endpoints.

## Installation

#### NPM

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev dictum.js
```

#### Yarn

```bash
$ yarn add --dev dictum.js
```

## Basic usage

The first step is to create a file in which we'll document our endpoints. So let's do that in `documentation.js`:

```node
var dictum = require('dictum.js');

// For every endpoints
dictum.document({
  description: 'Some description for the given endpoint',
  endpoint: '/some/endpoint',
  method: 'GET',
  requestHeaders: { /* headers for endpoint */ },
  requestPathParams: { /* path params for endpoint */ },
  requestBodyParams: { /* body params for endpoint */ },
  responseStatus: 200,
  responseHeaders: { /* headers for response */ },
  responseBody: { /* body params for response */ },
  resource: 'My Resource'
});
```

Second and last step, execute the created file to generate our html documentation in `./docs/index.html` like the following:

```bash
$ node documentation.js
```

## Easier usage

### Chai

If you pay attention to the basic usage, you will notice that it is a lot of boilerplate if your API has a lot of endpoints, this is not DRY. Luckily you can omit most of it when testing with chai:

```node
const chai = require('chai'),
  dictum = require('dictum.js'),
  server = require('./../app'),
  should = chai.should();

describe('/some/endpoint GET', () => {
  it('should fail login because of invalid username', () => {
    chai.request(server)
      .post('/some/endpoint')
      .then((res) => {
        res.should.have.status(200);
        res.should.be.json;
        dictum.chai(res, 'description for endpoint');
      });
    });
});
```
See the important line here:

```node
dictum.chai(res, 'description for endpoint');
```

Using `chai` returned `res` object will supply all the information we need to address the given endpoint. Optionally, we can provide a second parameter containing a description for it.

Then, documentation will be created when running our tests.

## Some other useful configurations

#### Markdown syntax instead of HTML? Change the formatter:

```node
dictum.setFormatter('markdown'); // default: 'html'
```

#### Publishing docs when using Express? Add:

```node
var express = require('express'),
  path = require('path'),
  app = express();

app.use('/docs', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'docs')));
```
